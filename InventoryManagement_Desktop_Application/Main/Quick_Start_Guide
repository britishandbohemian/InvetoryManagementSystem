To start your Node.js project, you typically follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to your project directory**: Open your terminal or command prompt, and use the `cd` command to change into your project's directory. For example, if your project is located in a folder named `my-node-project` on your desktop, you would use:
   ```bash
   cd Desktop/my-node-project
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**: If you haven't already installed your project's dependencies, or if you've just cloned the project from a repository, you need to install its dependencies. You can do this by running:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   This command reads the `package.json` file in your project directory and installs all the dependencies listed there.

3. **Start the project**: If your project was set up with a start script in the `package.json` file (commonly set up by many Node.js frameworks and generators like Express or Create React App), you can start your project by running:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   This command looks for a script named "start" in your `package.json` file and executes it. Typically, for Node.js projects, this script starts your Node.js server.

   If your project does not have a start script defined, you'll need to run your main file directly with Node. For example, if your main file is named `index.js`, you can start your project by running:
   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```

Here's an example of what a `package.json` file might contain in the scripts section:
```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "node index.js"
}
```
